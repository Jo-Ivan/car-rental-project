# car-rental-project

### current todos:
- [ ] finish up list your car page in front end
- [x] create a page that shows even more listing information by clicking card (users are able to see the description of the listing, contact the listing owner, and check for more pictures)
- [ ] plaintext password must be hashed
- [ ] login and register (can only list car/rent a car if authenticated)
- [ ] implement car model list table into 'list your car form' (possibly search bar that checks for a car in the database)
- [x] search option that queries if a certain car is available in the listing database
- [ ] let listing owner have an option if their car is currently being rented out
- [ ] let the listing owner delete their listing
- [ ] let other users contact the person who created the listing

### future todos:
- [x] nav bar should have highlights depending on which page it's on
- [ ] possibly make ui/ux even more simplified
- [ ] dummy online payment method?
